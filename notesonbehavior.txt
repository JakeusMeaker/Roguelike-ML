Added movement, ran but not interesting results
gave penalty for movement to encourage exploration, didnt improve
have added a view of the game map movement continued but still no interesting results
Gave a view of the visible map tiles, still stuck to one area and didn't explore much
created a reward delta for explored tiles to encourage movement, created better results including the agent finding and killing an enemy
