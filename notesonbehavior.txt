Added movement, ran but not interesting results
gave penalty for movement to encourage exploration, didnt improve
have added a view of the game map movement continued but still no interesting results
Gave a view of the visible map tiles, still stuck to one area and didn't explore much
created a reward delta for explored tiles to encourage movement,
added hp awareness to make encourage exploration
giving view of entities in the tiles adjacent
tried to add big reward for killing enemy nearby and took out heath penalty to encourage violence
reduced how many steps of the model to collect transitions for before learning starts
reduced the exploration fraction and the exploration initial eps to see what behaviour occurs
Given an observation of unexplored tiles and changed the reward to a minus figure. -1 good, 0 okay, 1 bad (I think)
taken away enemies to see if agent can find a soloution to the maze problem
set the steps to be redused by the exploration delta so htat the agent can live longer and explore more if they are more successful
Long corridors seem to encourage the behaviour of repeatedly going in the same direction
took away the -1 to reward as with this the reward could never be positive dues to the penatly of not exploring
