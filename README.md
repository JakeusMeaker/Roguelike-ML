# Roguelike-ML
This is my project for COMP704 - Machine Learning. 
It is a Roguelike game that has a player entity that has been trained to explore the map.
Enemies were initially in the game but were removed to aid in encouraging map exploration.
The most successful model has been a DQN which has produced the best results with my experimentation.
